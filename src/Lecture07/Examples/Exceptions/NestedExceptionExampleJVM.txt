This Java example demonstrates exception handling using try-catch-finally blocks:

1. The throwRuntimeException method simulates throwing a runtime exception.
2. The callThrowRuntimeException method calls throwRuntimeException.
3. In the main method:
- The program starts executing and prints "Starting execution...".
- callThrowRuntimeException is called, which may throw a runtime exception.
- If an exception occurs, it's caught by the catch block, printing "Caught a runtime exception."
- The finally block always executes, printing "Finally block executed."
- The program continues execution after the try-catch-finally block, printing "Execution continues...".

Overall, this example illustrates how to handle exceptions in Java using try-catch-finally blocks, ensuring that resources are properly managed even if an exception occurs.
